# Focus Follows Workspace

A [Gnome Shell Extension][1] that focuses (and moves the cursor to) the primary monitor after the
workspace was switched with a keyboard shortcut.

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4688/focus-follows-workspace/

This extension is meant to be used with a multi-monitor setup with the setting "Workspaces on
primary display only". It enables quick switching to an application on a given workspace via
keyboard by preventing the focus from being restored to a window on a secondary monitor.

It is compatible with the extension [Switch Workspace][2].

## Assigning Keyboard Shortcuts

Go to "Settings" > "Keyboard" > "View and Customize Shortcuts" > "Navigation" and assign keybindings for "Switch to workspace x".
